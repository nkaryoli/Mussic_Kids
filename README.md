Mussic Kids is an interactive web application designed for an online music school. It allows users to practice musical instruments virtually, playing sounds through mouse clicks or keyboard presses. The platform provides an engaging and educational experience, making music learning more accessible and interactive.

## 🎵 About the Project

This project is inspired by a web development exercise I completed during my fullstack bootcamp. I have built this version from scratch, applying my knowledge in responsive design, accessibility, and web optimization. The goal of this website is to showcase a modern and engaging platform for a music school.

## 🌟 Features

- Two interactive instruments (Piano and Bass Guitar).
- Realistic sound mapping corresponding to each instrument's keys or strings.
- Instruments can be played repeatedly with simultaneous sound output.
- Visual feedback when an instrument is played (movement effects and animations).

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- Animations: CSS and JavaScript.
